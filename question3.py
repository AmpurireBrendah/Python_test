# Question 3(i)
#  Write a Python program that prompts a user to enter numbers. The process will repeat until
#  the user enters 0. Finally, the program prints sum of the numbers entered by the user.

num1=float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2=float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3=float(input("Enter the third number: "))
num4=float(input("Enter the last number: "))
sum=num1+num2+num3+num4
print(f"The  sum of {num1} ,{num2}, {num3} and {num4} is : {sum}.")







# Question 3(ii)
# Write a Python program to print all the numbers from 1 to 100 that are not divisible by 2

numbers_from_1_to_100_not_divisible_by_2=[1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33,35,37,39,41,43,45,47,49,51,53,55,57,59,61,63,65,67,69,71,73,75,77,79,81,83,85,87,89,91,93,95,97,99,]
print(f"The numbers from 1 to 100 that are not divisible by 2 are :{numbers_from_1_to_100_not_divisible_by_2}")
